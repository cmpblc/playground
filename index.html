        <!--Adding some random content using header (h1-h6) and paragraph (p) commands-->
        <h1>This information is going to be BIG!</h1>
        <p>This is the first paragraph in my html document. It appears immediately after the first header, and is going to be followed by a page break (hopefully). I wonder if I'll be able to customise the styling using css in the near future.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>This information is going to be a wee bit smaller</h2>
        <p>This is the second paragraph in my html document. It appears immediately after the second header, and is going to be followed by a page break or 3.</p>
        <p>I thought I would add a second paragraph to this section to see how it looks on the page.</p>

        <!--Let's try some pre-formatted text-->
        <h3>Preformatted text</h3>
        <pre>Let's maybe try some nice tabulated information:

    Name            Age
    Joe Bloggs      23
    Jane Eyre       36
    Eric Cantona    56

    Let's see!</pre>
        <br></br>

         <!--Would like to now have a look at emphasised text-->
         <h4>Emphasised text</h4>
         <p>Within this paragraph, we have included some text which is <b>bold</b>, some which is in <i>italics</i>, some which is <strong>strong</strong> (which may look similar to bold text), and some which is <em>emphasised</em> (which may look similar to italics).</p>
         <br></br>
         <p>We can also include <s>text which is struck through</s></p>

            <p>Check out this quote from a famous person:</p>
            <blockquote>It is wise not to count ones chickens prior to them appearing out of the egg. For otherwise, said chickens may never appear, and one may end up with less chickens than one had initially anticipated.</blockquote>
