        <!--Adding some random content using header (h1-h6) and paragraph (p) commands-->
        <h1>This information is going to be BIG!</h1>
        <p>This is the first paragraph in my html document. It appears immediately after the first header, and is going to be followed by a page break (hopefully). I wonder if I'll be able to customise the styling using css in the near future.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>This information is going to be a wee bit smaller</h2>
        <p>This is the second paragraph in my html document. It appears immediately after the second header, and is going to be followed by a page break or 3.</p>
        <p>I thought I would add a second paragraph to this section to see how it looks on the page.</p>

        <!--Let's try some pre-formatted text-->
        <h3>Preformatted text</h3>
        <pre>Let's maybe try some nice tabulated information:

                Name            Age
                Joe Bloggs      23
                Jane Eyre       36
                Eric Cantona    56

            Let's see!
